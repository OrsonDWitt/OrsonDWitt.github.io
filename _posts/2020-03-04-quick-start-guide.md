I thought that a development roadmap is a great way to create a framework for more detailed updates in the future, so I sat down and thought of everything I've already done and what I'm planning to do. It's not a complete list — many technical things I could not even remember because I've been only focusing on the story recently. This goes on to show the value of such a roadmap and how it can keep me in line... and anxious, too; it helped me see that the storyline on which I've been working so hard did not even cover half of what I'm striving to do with this game.

Anyway, here it goes.

Step - Completion - Approximate date of completion

1. Backbone - 95%
1.1. Engine....100%
1.2. Mechanics.....90%
Most game mechanics are currently functioning, but have not yet been tested with the story. Bugs may appear as content is implemented.

2. Story - 60% - Apr 2020
2.1. Early years....97%
46 out 47 branches completed, a few problematic places left
2.2. Late years......80%
A few branches still remain untouched
2.3. City exploration.....83%
50 out of 60 possible exploration stories are finished
2.4. Ma'at events......20%
Have to be written after the mess with resources is figured out for optimal balance and to eliminate the need to re-do it
2.5. Resource management...20%
Resource management has to be figured out during the test build. Every choice has an estimated effect already, but the optimal balance has to be found

3. Seasonal activities
3.1. Buildings......80%
The city screen is functioning; most buildings have descriptions and some effects have been added to them.
3.2. Policies and technologies.......80%
Most policies and technologies are written in full, but the exact effects each of them is going to have on the game is still to be decided upon in the test build

Make it so that buildings, policies and storyline play/synergize nicely 

5. Visuals......0%
5.1. Artist found.......0%
I have not begun searching for an artist yet as the story has to be finished and tested first
5.1. Concept.....10%
The "ancient egyptian drawings that move as the story progresses" havr to be approved as a viable idea and drawn by the artist
5.2. Logos, capsule images.......0%
Beautiful art on the steam page, website, etc. has to capture attention of people interested in the game
5.3. UI.......10%
The user interface *works* and I have an idea of how it should look; however the artist that is going to work on the game might have better ideas.
5.4. Drawings......0%
All the art has to be drawn by the artist - backgrounds, characters, UI elements, etc.
5.4. Implementation.....0%
All the art has to be implemented into the game
5.5. Steam cards......0%
Steam cards need some additional effort to be implemented

6. Music - 50%
6.1. Get composers on board...........100%
Two great composers with experience in recreating Ancient Egyptian music have agreed to be a part of the project.
6.2. Figure out the best-fitting tunes for the game........0%
6.3. Loop & edit........0%
Talks ongoing with a professional musician
6.4. Implement to fit into the story............0%
Story has to be complemented with music in a fitting way.

7. Extras
7.1. Release for Mac....0%
7.2. Achievements......23%
From time to time, I think of achievements that can be implemented and write descriptions for them. 7/30 so far.
7.3. Localization.......0%
There are some people willing to help with localizing the game for Russian audience 


The mind-warping film opened with a hospital patient Simon Cable (Ryan Phillippe) awakening in a <span class="spoiler"> hospital with little knowledge (amnesia perhaps?) of what had happened, and why he was there, etc. He was told by attending Dr. Jeremy Newman (Stephen Rea) that it was July 29, 2002 (Simon thought it was the year 2000 - he was confused - he heard a doctor say 20:00 hours!) and that he had died for two minutes from cardiac arrest following the near-fatal accident -- but he had been revived ("You're as good as new").</span> Dr. Newman: "Simon, this is the 29th of July. The year is 2002. And your wife, whose name is Anna, is waiting outside." 

(The doctor left off four crucial additional words, revealed in the film's ending.) (Spoiler: Simon had died and was not resuscitated!).

A major clue to everything that truly happened was the scene that played next under the credits - hospital staff failed to bring a patient back to life with a defibrillator after a car accident. Chest compressions failed and there was no pulse. A second major clue was provided by hospital orderly Travis (Stephen Graham): <span class="spoiler">Everybody dies. No mystery there. But why and how everyone dies. Now, there's a mystery worth solving. Probably the biggest mystery there is.</span>

#### So how do we do spoilers?
