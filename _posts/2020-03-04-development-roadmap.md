I thought that a development roadmap is a great way to create a framework for more detailed updates in the future, so I sat down and thought of everything I've already done and what I'm planning to do. It's not a complete list — many technical things I could not even remember because I've been only focusing on the story recently. This goes on to show the value of such a roadmap and how it can keep me in line... and anxious, too; it helped me see that the storyline on which I've been working so hard did not even cover half of what I'm striving for with this game.

Anyway, here it goes.

The mind-warping film opened with a hospital patient Simon Cable (Ryan Phillippe) awakening in a <span class="spoiler"> hospital with little knowledge (amnesia perhaps?) of what had happened, and why he was there, etc. He was told by attending Dr. Jeremy Newman (Stephen Rea) that it was July 29, 2002 (Simon thought it was the year 2000 - he was confused - he heard a doctor say 20:00 hours!) and that he had died for two minutes from cardiac arrest following the near-fatal accident -- but he had been revived ("You're as good as new").</span> Dr. Newman: "Simon, this is the 29th of July. The year is 2002. And your wife, whose name is Anna, is waiting outside." 

(The doctor left off four crucial additional words, revealed in the film's ending.) (Spoiler: Simon had died and was not resuscitated!).

A major clue to everything that truly happened was the scene that played next under the credits - hospital staff failed to bring a patient back to life with a defibrillator after a car accident. Chest compressions failed and there was no pulse. A second major clue was provided by hospital orderly Travis (Stephen Graham): <span class="spoiler">Everybody dies. No mystery there. But why and how everyone dies. Now, there's a mystery worth solving. Probably the biggest mystery there is.</span>

#### So how do we do spoilers?
