# Hey there!
<font size="13px">
This pop-up will be used as a way to notify you if there's a new release (unless I find a better way...). Hope it's not too much of a bother!
<br>
For now, though, since this has just been released, there's nothing new. Enjoy the app, and let me know how you find it! 
<br>
No, really. I put my heart and soul into this and would love to hear it if you genuinely find it useful. ☺️
</font>
